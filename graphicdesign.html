            <h2 class="design-timeline-heading">August 2014</h2>
            <p class = "design-timeline-desc">Design has always fascinated me. My uncle is an exhibition designer, he got into design at a time when people in India
                had no idea of what it was, growing up around him I was exposed to the depth and the brilliance of the field. I had a
                natural inclination towards drawing art but being around him expanded my passion to encompass the filed of design in its
                entirety. I gave up drawing art back as a child when I moved to Pune, I simply got too busy trying to fit in, so when an
                opportunity to work as a graphic designer was presented to me in my freshman year of college, I took it. It was a
                calling I think, which I answered, and now that I look back I am so glad I did.

                <figcaption>
                    Android Wear was quite the thing then, so i decided to use that for the countdown poster.
                    Also went well with the overall technical theme of the event.

                    This was the cover image for our app on the Play Store. This was a fest put together entirely by students in
            their freshmen year. It allowed us to transition into the college culture, get to know each other, make memories and
            friendships. That is what the colors represent.

            <p class = "design-timeline-desc">
                In the winter of 2015, I received a message from a representative of the Pune Chapter of this organization called <a href="https://makeadiff.in/">Make a
                    Difference.</a> They were looking for a Graphic Designer and wondered if I would be interested in coming in for an
            interview. They had seen the work I had done for Spectrum 2015 and thought I might be a good fit. I agreed. A week later
            I was driving down to the venue, little did I know this would turn out to be the best decision I ever made in my college
            life.

                    When I applied for a graphic designer position at <a href="https://makeadiff.in/">MAD</a>, I was given a task which would decide whether I was
            suited for the position or not. The task was to design a graphic for a fictional Driving Happiness campaign.This poster
            was the one of the two entries. I was accepted :)

                Over the 2 years that I worked at <a href="https://makeadiff.in/">Make a
                    Difference.</a>, I produced a ton of designs across varied styles. I can't upload all of them here simply because there are too many, instead, I'll try to upload a few, each of which will touch upon a different aspect of the graphics I produced.
