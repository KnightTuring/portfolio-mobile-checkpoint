                <p class="main-intro-text">I've been working towards these goals of mine since my undergraduate days and continue to do so now as a 1st year graduate student at 
                    the University of Michigan studying Information Science with a focus in Applied Data Science and Social Computing.</p>

                <h2 class="title">What do my goals mean?</h2>
                <h3 class="goals-title">Empowerment</h3>
                <p class="goals-explanation"> Technology enables us to move beyond the barriers around us. it enables people around the globe to overcome their socio-economic 
                    limitations. However, there is still more left to do, more folks to be reached out to and I want to contribute in those efforts (The next billion users).</p>
                <h3 class="goals-title">Inspire communities</h3>
                <p class="goals-explanation">
               When people are empowered they achieve things, when they achieve, they share with their communities be it their friends, their family, or
                their neighbours. When people see others achieving, they are inspired to do more thus as one grows so does the possibility of their community growing.
                </p>
                <h3 class="goals-title">Advance humanity</h3>
                <p class="goals-explanation">
                As individuals grow and their communities grow, humanity as a whole progresses. As we move towards our lofty goals of becoming an 
                inter-planetary spacefaring species, transitioning to cleaner energy sources and developing the next generation of computing technologies it is more than 
                ever important for us to be united and to move forward as one.
